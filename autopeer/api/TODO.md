## Summary by Priority

### Must Have (Critical/High):
1. âœ… Main.rs integration tests (server startup, routing)
2. âœ… Middleware tests (JWT auth extractor)
3. âœ… API endpoint handler tests (all 6 endpoints)
4. âœ… WireGuard deployment tests
5. âœ… BIRD deployment tests

### Should Have (Medium):
6. Templates error handling
7. Config validation
8. Registry error cases

### Nice to Have (Low):
9. Full integration tests
10. Security edge cases
11. Performance tests

---

## Next Steps

1. Create test helpers for:
   - Temporary GPG keyring setup
   - Mock HTTP requests to API
   - Temporary file/directory management
   - Mock system commands (wg-quick, birdc)

2. Implement critical endpoint tests first:
   - Start with `init_peering()` - simplest flow
   - Then `verify_peering()` - uses GPG fixtures
   - Then deployment endpoints

3. Add integration tests using `axum::test` helpers

4. Mock system commands to avoid requiring root privileges
